Don't have much prior front-end experience before this, small News Article Design for Computer Science 160 Project.

# Notes
The project was made with simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of jQuery as well. It includes a home page, main articles page with a carousel for each section, article details page, and it includes a real-time commenting system, however, it does not save the comments on any database. This is for a Computer Science class at UC Berkeley, where we had to create a Working Prototype for a News-Related website. The focus of this project is to immerse our users with visuals, in order to captivate them and engage them with our content and community. 

You log in using Facebook. Currently the functionality for Facebook is not built, so it simply redirects to another static html page because this is supposed to represent a prototype.
